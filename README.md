## Description
Habit Rabbit is a daily habit tracking app that encourages users to keep habits alive. Users can create/adopt different habit rabbits, and collect acheivements after a certain amount of completions in a row. 

## Technologies Used

## Next Steps
In the future, I'd like to expand user achievements after record completions. I'd also like to make the habit form a bit more customizable, with the ability to change how many times a day the user would like to complete the habit.
